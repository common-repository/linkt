== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My charts are not showing
There was a conflict with the Google Site Kit plugin, which has been fixed in Linkt version 1.0.8.

As of version 1.0.8, you are not required to manually turn on the charts so please go to Dashboard -> Linkt's -> Settings and ensure you have enabled the charts to display.

= Can I change the URL extension to be something else besides /go/ ?
Yes! Simply go to Linkt -> Settings in your Dashboard and change it There.

= Why does it only show up to 2 months of statistics?
This isn't Google Analytics, we only save up to 2 months of click statistics so you can see what's happening with the clicks.

The most popular setting is to show the last 7 days statistics for weekly reports.

= Will I lose all my linkt's if I delete the plugin?
Only if you have turned on the setting for "Delete ALL data when Linkt is deleted", then the linkt's and meta will be deleted.

If you leave it unchecked then the Linkt's will not be deleted.
